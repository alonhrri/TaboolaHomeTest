## Getting Started

I have chosen to write this test with Swift lang.
3 Parts to accomplish:

* Part 2: Add TaboolaView to collectionView
* Part 3: Communicate between two apps with deep linking

### guiding principles

* Taboola is looking for code that is:
* Working

* Well designed (Object Oriented)
* Simple
